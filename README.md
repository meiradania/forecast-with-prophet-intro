Would you recommend it for a Python-intermediate but forecasting-noob? I was looking into forecasting with Prophet for healthcare data for a project I'm working on. Thanks! :+1: 1   DÃ¢nia Meira  21 hours ago Hey Christina, yes totally recommended. We are going to start from basics of both time series forecasting and Prophet. Previous python knowledge helps, specially if you have worked before with pandas and scikit-learn
